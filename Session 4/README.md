## Hard Shadows

This week follows on from the Ray Tracing algorithm you developed in Week 3. You need to
have completed at least workshop 2A to add shadows. This week involves standard ray
tracing to create hard shadows as shown below:

Detailed instruction of implementation can be found in _"Workshop 3A Instructions.pdf"_
 
## Soft Shadows

It is advanced level and optional. 
This week follows on from the last session. This week involves distributed ray tracing to create soft shadows.

Detailed instruction of implementation can be found in _"Workshop 3B Instructions.pdf"_
