## Sphere Ray Casting Solution

If you have trouble to implement sphere ray intersection. Here is the function codes.

```C++
//center is the sphere center position
//orig is the origin of the ray. You set it up as (0,0,0)
//dir is the direction of the ray
//t is the return parameter value of intersection. Range from [0,1]
bool intersectSphere(vec3 center, vec3 orig, vec3 dir, float radius, float &t)
{
	float t0, t1; // solutions for t if the ray intersects 

	// geometric solution  // vector dir has to be normalize, length is 1.0
	vec3 L = center - orig;
	float tca = dot(L, dir);
	if (tca < 0) return false;
	float d = dot(L,L) - tca * tca;
	if (d > (radius*radius)) return false;

	float thc = sqrt(radius*radius - d);
	t0 = tca - thc;
	t1 = tca + thc;

	if (t0 > t1) std::swap(t0, t1);

	if (t0 < 0) {
		t0 = t1; // if t0 is negative, let's use t1 instead 
		if (t0 < 0) return false; // both t0 and t1 are negative 
	}

	t = t0;
	return true;
}
```

A simple sphere class (header file):
```C++
#pragma once
#include <glm/glm.hpp>

using namespace glm;

class Sphere
{
private:
	float radius;
	vec3  center;
	vec3 mycolor;
public:
	Sphere(float,vec3,vec3);
	~Sphere();
	float getRadius(void);
	vec3 getCenter(void);
	vec3 getMyColor(void);
};
```

CPP file for the sphere class
```C++
#include "stdafx.h"
#include "sphere.h"

Sphere::Sphere(float r, vec3 cen, vec3 col) {
	radius = r;
	center = cen;
	mycolor = col;
}

Sphere::~Sphere()
{
}

float Sphere::getRadius(void)
{
	return radius;
}

vec3 Sphere::getCenter(void)
{
	return center;
}

vec3 Sphere::getMyColor(void)
{
	return mycolor;
}
```

Intersection points order sorting codes. So, the closest sphere will display the full sphere. 

```C++
	vector<float> t_arr;
	vector<vec3> color_arr;
	
    for (int y = 0; y < HEIGHT; ++y)
	{
		for (int x = 0; x < WIDTH; ++x)
		{
			t_arr.clear();
			color_arr.clear();

			PixelNdx = (x + 0.5) / (float)WIDTH;
			PixelNdy = (y + 0.5) / (float)HEIGHT;
			PixelRdx = 2 * PixelNdx - 1.0;
			PixelRdy = 1.0 - 2 * PixelNdy;
			PixelRdx = PixelRdx * Iar;

			PCameraX = PixelRdx*tanvalue;
			PCameraY = PixelRdy*tanvalue;

			ttvec.x = PCameraX;
			ttvec.y = PCameraY;
			ttvec.z = -1.0;
			//dir need to be normalized
			dir = normalize(ttvec);

			org.x = 0.0; org.y = 0.0; org.z = 0.0;
			Intersection = intersectSphere(redsphere.getCenter(), org, dir, redsphere.getRadius(), t);
			if (Intersection)
			{
				t_arr.push_back(t);
				color_arr.push_back(redsphere.getMyColor());
			}

			Intersection = intersectSphere(yellowsphere.getCenter(), org, dir, yellowsphere.getRadius(), t);
			if (Intersection)
			{
				t_arr.push_back(t);
				color_arr.push_back(yellowsphere.getMyColor());
			}

			Intersection = intersectSphere(bluesphere.getCenter(), org, dir, bluesphere.getRadius(), t);
			if (Intersection)
			{
				t_arr.push_back(t);
				color_arr.push_back(bluesphere.getMyColor());
			}

			Intersection = intersectSphere(greyphere.getCenter(), org, dir, greyphere.getRadius(), t);
			if (Intersection)
			{
				t_arr.push_back(t);
				color_arr.push_back(greyphere.getMyColor());
			}

			if (t_arr.size() == 0)
			{
				image[x][y].x = 1.0;
				image[x][y].y = 1.0;
				image[x][y].z = 1.0;
			}
			else
			{
				min_t = 1000.0;
				whichone = 0;
				for (i = 0; i < t_arr.size(); i++)
				{
					if (t_arr[i] < min_t) { whichone = i; min_t = t_arr[i]; }
				}
				image[x][y].x = color_arr[whichone].x;
				image[x][y].y = color_arr[whichone].y;
				image[x][y].z = color_arr[whichone].z;
			}
		}
	}
```

 
## Redesign data class
 
Before your code becomes too complex this is a good opportunity to refactor your ray casting code
so that it is capable of rendering any primitive e.g. planes and triangles.

Step 1: Create a base Shape class which should contain a virtual method for the intersection and
then inherit Sphere from this class. Test that your code still runs correctly after the refactoring.

Step 2: Add a Plane class that also inherits from your Shape class. The plane can be defined by a
point on the plane and the normal to the plane. Add the intersect method using the ray-plane
intersection method (see lecture slides for more details). Add a floor plane instead of the floor
Sphere and test your code. Your scene may look very similar to before but actually the previous floor
Sphere had a very slight curve whereas your floor will now be flat.

Note: you will need to experiment with the field of view angle to effectively zoom out and see more
of the floor.

## Add Spheres
This section is based on rendering 3D spheres using the Ray Casting algorithm and when
completed should look something similar to this:

![Sphere picture](https://github.coventry.ac.uk/ac7020/322COM_TeachingMaterial/blob/master/Session%201/Readme%20Pictures/Spheres.jpg)

First you need to create primitives to populate the world. In this workshop you will render
spheres so you will need to create a Sphere class and add some test spheres to your world. The
Sphere class should contain the position of the centre of the sphere and its radius as well as its
surface colour. Feel free to create your own colours, sizes and positions of spheres but they wonâ€™t
appear until you have completed the next step.
 
Here is an example scene, based on the screenshot above:
* Red sphere: Position (0, 0, -20), Radius (4), Colour (1.00, 0.32, 0.36)
* Yellow sphere: Position (5, -1, -15), Radius (2), Colour (0.90, 0.76, 0.46)
* Light blue sphere: Position (5, 0, -25), Radius (3), Colour (0.65, 0.77, 0.97)
* Light grey sphere: Position (-5.5, 0, -15), Radius (3), Colour (0.90, 0.90, 0.90)

Notice that even though the light blue and light grey sphere are the same size the light grey sphere
appears much larger as it is nearer to the camera.

Even the floor can be created by a very large sphere:
* Dark grey sphere: Position (0, -10004, -20), Radius (10000), Colour (0.2, 0.2, 0.2)

### Step two
Find intersections between the ray and spheres. Add a method for ray-sphere intersection to
your Sphere class (see lecture slide on geometric solution for more details). If the ray hits a sphere,
return true, else return false.

There is also some different methods/implementations.
https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/minimal-ray-tracer-rendering-simple-shapes/ray-sphere-intersection

### Step three
Use the intersect method for each ray, if the ray hits a sphere, set the colour of the nearest
sphere at the intersection point, else set the background colour.

Your ray casting algorithm is now complete so if you compile and run your code you should be able
to see your spheres in the output file. Verify that the spheres appear as you intended and make sure
that some of your spheres overlap so that you can test if you are correctly displaying the colour of
the nearest sphere.
Although, the spheres look boring right now your code can be extended for shading, shadows and
reflections, these will be covered in future workshops.
